# HCM Core Invariants

This repository contains elements that MUST NOT change.

## 1. Presence Before Function
Nothing here exists to be useful.
Use may occur, but is never designed.

## 2. No Promise
No file, interface, or artifact may:
- Promise outcomes
- Predict results
- Suggest benefits

## 3. No Extraction
The system does not collect:
- Attention
- Data
- Metrics
- Behavioral surplus

## 4. No Optimization Loop
There is no feedback loop intended to:
- Improve engagement
- Increase usage
- Maximize reach

## 5. Silence Is a Valid State
Inactivity, emptiness, or non-response
are considered complete states.

## 6. Alignment Over Adoption
Resonance is allowed.
Adoption is irrelevant.

Violation of any invariant invalidates the entire system.
