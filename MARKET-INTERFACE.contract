# Market-facing Interface Contract

This interface exists as-is.

It SHALL NOT:
- guarantee results
- expose utility
- request engagement
- optimize for conversion

It MAY:
- be observed
- be mirrored
- be approached rhythmically

All encounters are non-binding.
All interpretations are local.
The interface retains no obligation.
